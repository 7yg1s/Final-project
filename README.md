This is the final project for Data analytics course at Vilnius Coding School.
The goal is to get neccessary data from web, clean it and analyse. Check how air quality is changing according years, region 
and compare statistics to live data from  different cities in Lithuania.
For this project we used Python language with some of its libraries, CSV files for saving data and PowerBi for visualisations.
